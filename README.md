# Digital.Image.Processing Homeworks
This is a personal repo holds my assignments for the digital image processsing course Spring24.
MATLAB code is written via **Octave 9** loaded by **image package**. for the major part its readly runable in **MATLAB**, although some work arounds maybe needed (very occasionally).

## Assignements folder
holds  the course assignements as per the course teacher.

## Playground folder 
holds my personal experimenting, outside the scope of the course.
